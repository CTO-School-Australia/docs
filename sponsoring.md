## Let us get to know your company!
CTO School meets monthly, with a break in January. That gives you, our potential sponsor, just 11 sessions to put your brand in front of a room full of Melbourne tech decision makers and influencers.

Provide some food and drink for our meetup and we'd be happy to give you the stage at the start of our session for a quick spot of whatever you'd like to say. We'd just ask that it follows our Code of Conduct, is relevant to the audience and has more to offer than just advertising your product/service.

## What's it cost?
We tend to cater for around 30-35 attendees, and allow for 20% vegetarian and vegan options.

* Pizza is probably $5/head. 
* Wrap platters from Woolworths are around $6/head. 
* Subway platter is around $7-$8/head. 
* Miss Chu's is approx $10/head. 

Plus beverages. 5x2lt bottles of a mix of soft drink and mineral water have been sufficient in the past.
